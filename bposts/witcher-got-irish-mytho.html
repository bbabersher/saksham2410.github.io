        <h2>The best of Irish Mythology and their Comparison</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p><em>8 June 2018</em></p>

        <p>
I was home for as far back as multi-week, having a necessary get-away enforced by my family. I spent it reading the Witcher series. To those of you who don't think about them, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski#The_Witcher_Saga">The Witcher</a> is a polish fantasy series by Andrzej Sapkowski. In the conclusion of many, what makes them unmistakable from fantasy series like LOTR and Harry Potter are the dim shades of ethical quality depicted on the planet. In LOTR and HP, there is a good and there is an evil and toward the day's end, the good needs to triumph over evil. In Witcher, each choice faced has fluctuating results for various characters; great and terrible. This captivates the eye, as a result of its <i>natural</i> appeal.
</p>
<p>
Game of Thrones, the famous TV series, is the second thing that rings a bell when you think about a dark depiction of the world. I have not perused the ASOIF books, but rather I am an avid follower of the show and subsequently trust I have a thought of the major key points of the show. Furthermore, what I'll be discussing here are the striking similarities on a portion of the plotlines of Witcher and Game of Thrones. Some of them are worked out of fan speculations I read about GoT also.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Political and sexual interest, despite the fact that since Witcher is based on one individual and his fate, the political perspectives are maybe not as intricate as GoT. </li>
<li>Witcher has an elven race Aen Sidhe, and GoT's white walkers resemble sidhe made of ice, both got from Ao Si in Irish mythology. We likewise realize that Children of the Forest made White Walkers so they represent Aen Sidhe better, and afterward, they have a sister race called Aen Elle which resembles a portrayal of the Others in Irish mythology, and of WW in GoT. Witcher's Aen Elle have their own rendition of rogue riders called the Wild Hunt. </li>
<li>A noteworthy issue which encompasses the world according to a prediction is the happening to an extraordinary winter; an incredible iceage, the Big Winter, the Big Chill, Aep Deireadh and numerous different names used for a long iceage. Witcher acquires a touch of science too by examining that this will be because of a change in tilt of Earth's hub.</li>
<li>Both have a character who can go through Space and Time. This is Witcher's Cirilla or Ciri, and GoT's Brandon Stark. In spite of the fact that, on account of GoT, it is just fans speculations which discuss a destiny. Witcher, then again, is extremely explicit to revolve the story around Ciri's fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent extended periods hunting down well known Irish mythological stories so we could set up a connection. Witcher was distributed before ASOIF and ASOIF were distributed when Witcher was outstanding to the English speaking world. These are just my reflections.
